# Project Description:
This was project developed as team assignment at Air Care Vol.2 Brainster Hackathon. 
The assignment was to create a web app for reporting air pollution and to provide a user-friendly platform that allows individuals to easily and effectively report air pollution incidents. By creating this web app we will also help the people from the local government as inspectors that will be responsible for making sure that every report gets solved and something is accomplished. The ultimate goal is to locate the origin of the pollution in the city of Skopje.
Our goal as Data Sci–µntists in the team was to create PowerBI dashboard that will help the highest authorities in the inspectorate, to determine the work of the inspectors and their actions after the complaints received from the citizens.
